  cause: microdeletion
  definition: Distal 17p13.3 microdeletion syndrome is a rare partial monosomy of
    the short arm of chromosome 17 with a variable phenotype characterized by prenatal
    and postnatal growth retardation, developmental delay, mild intellectual disability,
    macrocephaly, mild facial dysmorphisms including prominent forehead, hypertelorism,
    thick upper and/or lower lip vermillion, and structural abnormalities of the brain
    variably including white matter abnormalities, prominent Virchow-Robin spaces,
    Chiari I malformation, corpus callosum hypoplasia, but no lissencephaly.

  cause: deletion
  definition: Miller-Dieker Syndrome (MDS) is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome
    of chromosome 17p13.3, characterised by classical lissencephaly (lissencephaly
    type 1) and distinct facial features. Additional congenital malformations can
    be part of the condition.
