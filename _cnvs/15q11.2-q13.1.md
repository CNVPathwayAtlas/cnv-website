  The 15q11.2-q13.1 copy number variation syndrome can result in the loss or duplication of up to 20 protein-coding genes, leading to widespread effects on human development. This region includes well-studied syndromes such as Prader-Willi and Angelman.

      A rare genetic, neurodevelopmental syndrome, also known as Prader-Willi syndrome, characterized by hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction with severe hypotonia and feeding deficits during the neonatal period followed by an excessive weight gain period with hyperphagia with a risk of severe obesity during childhood and adulthood, learning difficulties, deficits of social skills and behavioral problems or severe psychiatric problems.

      15q11.2 microdeletion syndrome is a rare partial autosomal monosomy with a variable phenotypic expression and reduced penetrance associated with an increased susceptibility to neuropsychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders including delayed psychomotor development, speech delay, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, epilepsy or seizures. It may also include mild non-specific dysmorphic features (such as dysplastic ears, broad forehead, hypertelorism), cleft palate, neurological and neuroimaging abnormalities (such as ataxia and muscular hypotonia).

      A rare, complex chromosomal duplication/inversion in the region 15q11.2-q13.1 characterized by early central hypotonia, global developmental delay and intellectual deficit, autistic behavior, and seizures.
    pubmed_ids:
      - 8050626
      - 21359847
    cause: duplication/inversion
    omim: 
    prevalence: Prevalence at birth is estimated at 1 in 30,000 but may be an underestimate. In patients with developmental concerns (developmental delay, intellectual disability, or autism spectrum disorder) or multiple congenital anomalies, the prevalence of partial tetrasomy of chromosome 15 is estimated to range between 1/253-584. There is an observed male predilection of 2:1.
