      Distal 7q11.23 microdeletion syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly characterized by epilepsy, neurodevelopmental disorder variably including developmental delays and intellectual disabilities of variable severity, learning disability and neurobehavioral abnormalities (autism spectrum disorder, hyperactivity, impulsivity, aggression, self-abusive behaviors, depression).

      A rare genetic multisystemic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a distinct facial appearance, cardiac anomalies (most frequently supravalvular aortic stenosis), cognitive and developmental abnormalities, and connective tissue abnormalities (e.g., joint laxity). Facial dysmorphism is characterized by a broad forehead, bitemporal narrowing, periorbital fullness, stellate and/or lacy iris pattern, short upturned nose with bulbous tip, long philtrum, wide mouth, full lips and mild micrognathia.

    cause: microdeletion (WBS)
    omim: 
      - 194050
    prevalence: Prevalence is approximately 1/7,500. There is no difference between the sexes.

      Distal 7q11.23 microduplication syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly characterized by a predominantly neuropsychiatric phenotype with a few dysmorphic characteristics. Speech delay, learning difficulties, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and aggressiveness have been reported. Williams-Beuren region duplication syndrome also know as Somerville-van der AA syndrome.
